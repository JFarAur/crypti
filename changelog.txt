v0.2.0
- Added a new analysis which attempts to detect common hashing algorithms. Currently the supported algorithms are:
  * MD4/MD5
  * FNV-1/FNV-1a, 32-bit and 64-bit variants
  * SipHash
  * bcrypt
  * SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
- Functions with detected hashing algorithms are annotated alongside the XmmXor results, which can help the user in identifying
  some of the "garbage string" results.

v0.1.4
- Some code refactoring and optimizations.
- Improved emulation of registers and values in some specific scenarios.

v0.1.3
- Greatly improved function detection on x64 using function data from the exception directory.

v0.1.2
- Added support for 256-bit and 512-bit vector instructions (vmovdqa, vmovdqu, vpxor, etc), greatly improving the variety of strings that can be decrypted.

v0.1.1
- Improved the heuristic for detecting UTF-16 strings. UTF-16 strings are detected with much better accuracy.
- Added support for more immediate value types. Previously only imm32, imm64, and imm32/64 were emulated, now all types are emulated.
